# Indexing in Pandas

Way back in the [introduction to data frames](../data-frames/data_frame_intro),
we covered indexing into data frames with *Boolean vectors*, such as Pandas
Series or Numpy arrays, and indexing into data frames with column names.

We call this type of indexing *simple indexing*

This page covers more sophisticated indexing in Pandas - *advanced indexing*.

<!---
Summary:

   Labels with loc
   Positions with iloc
-->

To understand advanced indexing, we first need to cover the *index* of data
frames and Series.  The *index* contains the *row labels* for a data frame or
series.

We start with our usual imports:

```{python}
# Load the Numpy library, rename to "np"
import numpy as np

# Load the Pandas data science library, rename to "pd"
import pandas as pd

# Safe settings for Pandas.
pd.set_option('mode.chained_assignment', 'raise')
```

## The index

We return to our first data frame, containing statistics on development and
gender from the World Bank.

This is the {download}`gender_stats.csv <../data/gender_stats.csv>` file.
See [the gender stats data
page](https://github.com/odsti/datasets/tree/master/gender_stats) for
some more detail.

Download that file to the same directory as this notebook, if you are running
on your own computer.

```{python}
# Load the data file as a data frame.
gender_data = pd.read_csv('gender_stats.csv')

# Show the first 10 rows
gender_data.head(10)
```

As you know, the names at the top, in **bold typeface**, are the names of the
columns.  We can see these names using the `columns` attribute of the data
frame:

```{python}
gender_data.columns
```

These can also be called the *column labels*.


We have not paid attention so far to the numbers at the left of the table
display, also in bold typeface.

In this case, they are ascending integers, starting at 0, with value 0 for the
first row, 1 for the second row, and so on.

These numbers are the *index* of the data frame.  The index contains the *row
labels*.

We can see the row labels / index with the `index` attribute of the data frame.

```{python}
gender_data.index
```

This is saying we have a simple index, that is like a `np.arange`, starting at
0, and continuing in steps of 1 up to, but not including 216.

So far, the index looks like row numbers, with 0 for the first row, 1 for the
second row.  We will soon see that the index is more than that.


For example, let us look at the last 15 rows.  We can get these with the `tail`
method of the data frame.

```{python}
last_15 = gender_data.tail(15)
last_15
```

Here is the `index` of this new data frame.

```{python}
last_15.index
```

Notice that the first row of this new data frame no longer has the label 0 - it
has label 201.  These numbers are the labels from the original data frame, from
which we selected the rows.

Notice too that the second row in this table is the USA, and it has the label
\202.


Now imagine that I sort the original data frame by Gross Domestic Product, and
select the top 15 rows.  By doing this, I select the top 15 richest countries.

```{python}
# Sort by GDP.
df_by_gdp = gender_data.sort_values('gdp_us_billion', ascending=False)
# Take the top 15 rows.
richest_15 = df_by_gdp.head(15)
richest_15
```

Now notice that the index values have followed their respective rows.  The row
for the USA is now first, but it has kept its original index value (row label)
\- 202.  The index value *identifies* the row.

Here is the index for this small table:

```{python}
richest_15.index
```

Now let us say that I wanted to get the eleventh row of this table.

I would be tempted to do something like `richest_15[10]` - but then - what
would Pandas give me?   Does `10` mean the row label for "Australia"?  Or does
it mean the eleventh row of the table, as it would for an array, and therefore
the row for "Canada"?  That is, will the indexing using the *labels* (index
values)?  Or will it use the positions (as for indexing in Numpy arrays)?

The answer is, it is ambiguous, and when things are ambiguous, Pandas has to
guess.   That's a bad idea, because then we have to guess what Pandas has
guessed, and it is starting to get really confusing.

For that reason, we careful Pandas users do not index rows with code like
`richest_15[10]`.  When we are not using Booleans to select rows, we always use
one of the two indexing attributes that Pandas provides.  Each does a different
type of indexing.

* The `loc` (label locate) attribute indexes using the *labels* (row index).
* The `iloc` (position locate) attribute indexes using the positions.

Here they are in action:

```{python}
# Get the row with label 10
richest_15.loc[10]
```

```{python}
# Get the row at position / offset 10
richest_15.iloc[10]
```

In more details, what is happening in the first cell above is that
`richest_15.loc` gives us a special value (AKA *object*) that:

* knows about the `richest_15` data frame;
* will give us rows and columns, if we use `[ something ]` on it.

So, read `richest_15.loc[10]` as:

* Get the `richest_15` value (the data frame);
* Get the `loc` attribute of this data frame. This evaluates to a special
  object (value) that can give us rows and columns from the data frame, by
  looking at labels;
* Use this object to fetch the row labeled 10, by using indexing (`[10]`)


Likewise, read `richest_15.iloc[10]` as:

* Get the `richest_15` value (the data frame);
* Get the `iloc` attribute of this data frame. This evaluates to a special
  object (value) that can give us rows and columns from the data frame, by
  looking at positions (offsets);
* Use this object to fetch the row at offset 10, by using indexing (`[10]`).


When you select rows and columns from a data frame, consider carefully what you
want.

Do you want to select rows and columns by *label* (by *index*, in the rows).
Then you want `.loc`.

Do you want to select rows and columns by *position* (offset).  Then you want
`.iloc`.

## Loc and iloc indexing work on columns too


Consider this.  We use `.loc` and the label for the *row*, followed by the
label for the *column*.

```{python}
richest_15.loc[10, 'gdp_us_billion']
```

This selects the row *labeled* 10 (the USA row) and returns the value from the
`gdp_us_billion` column.

Conversely, `iloc` only understands positions, and so, integers.  It does not
understand or use labels:

```{python tags=c("raises-exception")}
# We can't specify columns by label, using iloc.
richest_15.iloc[10, 'gdp_us_billion']
```

Notice the somewhat informative error right at the bottom of the error message.


`iloc` can get columns by their position.  For example, `fertility_rate` is the
third column, and so we can get the fertility rate by asking `iloc` for the
eleventh row, third column, like so:

```{python}
richest_15.iloc[10, 2]
```

This is the value from the row at offset 10 and the column at offset 2.


## Series have an index too


Data frames have columns (and column labels), and rows (with row labels --- the
index).

Series also have element labels --- they also have an index.

Consider this column, of the fertility rates of the richest countries:

```{python}
# Get the fert_rate column from the data frame
rich_ferts = richest_15['fert_rate']
rich_ferts.head()
```

As y'all know, this is a Series:

```{python}
type(rich_ferts)
```

You probably also spotted the numbers to the left of the values.  Yes, the row
labels have come across from the data frame into the Series.  We can see that
the first element has row label 202, and we remember that this is the row label
(index value) for the USA.


As for the data frames, here is the index for the series:

```{python}
rich_ferts.index
```

Like data frames, we can index by label, with `loc`, and by position, with
`iloc`:

```{python}
# The value for row labeled 10 - Australia.
rich_ferts.loc[10]
```

```{python}
# The value for the row at position 10 - Canada
rich_ferts.iloc[10]
```

## Rows from data frames are Series


Here we select the row at position 0 (the first row):

```{python}
first_row = richest_15.iloc[0]
first_row
```

This is a Series:

```{python}
type(first_row)
```

Notice that the Series has 9 elements, one for each column in the data frame.

As you remember, we can see the number of rows and columns in a data frame
with:

```{python}
richest_15.shape
```

Remember, the columns have names, which we can also call *labels*.

When we select a row out of a data frame, we have one element per column, and
the labels for the columns now become the labels for the rows.

```{python}
first_row.index
```

As for any other Series, we can get elements by label, with `loc`:

```{python}
first_row.loc['fert_rate']
```

We can also get elements by position (offset), with `iloc`:

```{python}
first_row.iloc[0]
```

## You can index without loc and iloc, but please don't, except ...


In the [data frame introduction](../data-frames/data_frame_intro), you saw that we can
index into data frame directly, using `[ something ]` after the data frame
value, without using `loc` or `iloc`.  Call this *direct indexing*.  This is
a very reasonable thing to do if:

* the `something` is a Boolean sequence.  This is not ambiguous.
* the `something` is a column name.  This isn't ambiguous either.

We used both types of direct indexing in the data frame introduction page.

For example, both of these are entirely reasonable uses of direct indexing:

```{python}
# Direct Boolean indexing:
# Select rows where 'health_exp_per_cap' is greater than 3000 dollars.
is_big_spender = richest_15['health_exp_per_cap'] > 3000  # Boolean Series
big_health_spenders = richest_15[is_big_spender]
big_health_spenders
```

```{python}
# Direct indexing with column label:
# Select the 'country_code' column.
country_code = richest_15['country_code']
country_code
```

Those uses of direct indexing are entirely sensible.  Other uses of direct indexing are not sensible, and we strongly encourage you not to use them.

For example, Pandas will also allow you to this, with the Series we just made:

```{python}
# Nooooooo !
country_code[10]
```

Please don't do that.  This is ambiguous.  Did you really mean the country with
label 10?  Or did you mean the country at position 10?   Pandas will guess for
you.  Don't let it.  If you are not selecting rows / elements with Booleans,
always do this:

```{python}
# By label
country_code.loc[10]
```

or this:

```{python}
# By position
country_code.iloc[10]
```

## You can use Boolean indexing with loc


It is often convenient to use direct indexing with Booleans, as we have just seen:

```{python}
# Create a Boolean series with True for big spender rows, False otherwise.
is_big_spender = richest_15['health_exp_per_cap'] > 3000
is_big_spender
```

```{python}
# Direct Boolean indexing:
# Select rows where 'health_exp_per_cap' is greater than 3000 dollars.
big_health_spenders = richest_15[is_big_spender]
big_health_spenders
```

We can also use Booleans with `loc` indexing.  This allows us to do things such
as selecting rows with Booleans, and columns with labels, in one shot, like
this:

```{python}
# Boolean indexing for rows, with "loc"
# Get "country_name" column values for big health spenders:
big_spender_names = richest_15.loc[is_big_spender, 'country_name']
big_spender_names
```

In fact you can use some Boolean sequences with `iloc` as well, but that needs
[a little more explanation](../functions-conditionals/booleans_and_labels).
