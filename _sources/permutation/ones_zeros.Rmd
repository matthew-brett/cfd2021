# Arrays of ones and zeros

<!---
This page retired; we are not using 2D arrays until much later.
-->

```{python}
import numpy as np
```

We often want to create arrays with all zeros, or all ones.

We do this with:

```{python}
np.zeros(5)
```

```{python}
np.ones(3)
```

As ever, review the help with (for example):

```
np.ones?
```

In a new cell.


You can ask for a 2D array by passing a list with the numbers of rows and columns:

```{python}
np.zeros([5, 2])
```
