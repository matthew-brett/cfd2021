# Array indexing exercises

These exercises follow on from the [array indexing page](../arrays/array_indexing).

Run this cell to start:

```{python}
import numpy as np
```

So far we have seen arrays that contain numbers. Here is an
array that contains strings:

```{python}
some_words = np.array(['to', 'be', 'or', 'not', 'to', 'be'])
some_words
```

## Indexing with integers

Use indexing with integers to display the first word in
`some_words`.

```{python}
# Your code here
```

Use indexing with integers to display the word "not".

```{python}
# Your code here
```

Here is a Boolean array that has `True` where the word in the matching position of `some_words` is "be":

```{python}
bees = some_words == 'be'
bees
```

Use Boolean indexing to show an array with the two instances of "be" from `some_words`.


```{python}
# Your code here
```

Use Boolean indexing to show an array with the two instances of "to" from `some_words`.

```{python}
# Your code here
```

Use Boolean indexing to show an array with the single instance
of "not" from `some_words`.

```{python}
# Your code here
```
